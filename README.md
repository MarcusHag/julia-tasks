##Building construction
Building construction describes the physical activity on a construction site that contributes to building or structure construction. This process involves unloading plant, machinery, materials, cladding, fixture, fitting of installations, formwork, and external finish. 
The building construction process is a series of routine tasks completed by skilled persons. It involves a lot of time and tedious work and must be managed carefully. This process can be split into three phases: pre-construction, construction, and post-construction.
